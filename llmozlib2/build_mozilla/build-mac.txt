Prerequisite libraries (IDL and GLib) can be installed via the "macports" tool available here:

http://www.macports.org/

I did an install using the Leopard disk image, then:

sudo /opt/local/bin/port sync
sudo /opt/local/bin/port install libidl

This installed expat, libiconv, gettext, pkgconfig, glib2, libIDL

After installing macports, I had to make sure /opt/local/bin was in my path (which involved closing and reopening my terminal window).
